# Garage Management System Documentation Introduction

The Garage Management System is a comprehensive web-based application built using the powerful combination of .NET Core and Angular frameworks. It aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for efficiently managing vehicles within a garage, offering features such as registration, maintenance, and tracking functionalities.

## Components
### Server-side
    Controllers: Responsible for handling incoming requests from the client and providing appropriate responses.
    Models: Define the data structures and entities utilized throughout the application.
    Data Access Layer (DAL): Facilitates interaction with the database, leveraging the capabilities of Entity Framework Core.
    Services: Implement the application logic and work closely with the DAL to read from and write to the database.
    SignalR: Empowers real-time communication between the server and client, ensuring instant updates and notifications.

### Client-side:
    Components: Building blocks of the user interface, rendering specific sections of the application.
    Services: Implement client-side application logic, communicating with the server-side API using the HTTP client.
    Directives: Add dynamic behavior to HTML elements, enhancing interactivity.
    Pipes: Enable data transformation before display, providing a tailored user experience.
    Models: Define the necessary data structures employed within the application.

## Design Patterns and Principles

The Garage Management System adheres to essential design patterns and principles, fostering maintainability and scalability:

    Model-View-Controller (MVC): The application's architecture embraces the MVC pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. Server-side API controllers serve as the controllers, while client-side components handle the views.
    Repository pattern: The DAL incorporates the repository pattern to encapsulate data access logic, promoting a clean separation of concerns and enhancing code organization.
    Dependency Injection (DI): The application effectively manages dependencies between components, leveraging DI for loose coupling and increased flexibility.
    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each component in the application adheres to the SRP, ensuring clear responsibilities and focused functionality.
    Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): The application actively avoids code duplication, promoting code reuse to enhance maintainability and reduce errors.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

The Garage Management System leverages modern deployment practices and infrastructure technologies:

    Deployment: The application is packaged as a Docker container, allowing for easy deployment to various cloud platforms such as Azure or AWS.
    CI/CD: CI/CD pipelines, such as GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps, streamline the deployment process, automating build, test, and release stages.

## Security

To ensure the utmost security of user data and system functionality, the Garage Management System implements robust security measures:
    Authentication and Authorization: User authentication is implemented using industry-standard JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing secure access to the system's functionalities while protecting sensitive data.
    Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.

## Performance and Scalability

The Garage Management System focuses on delivering optimal performance and scalability:

    Paging, Sorting, and Filtering: Efficiently handles large datasets, offering enhanced performance by retrieving and displaying data in smaller, manageable portions.
    Real-time Communication: Employing SignalR, the system ensures real-time updates and notifications, facilitating seamless collaboration and immediate status updates.
